# Face Recognition
 **Using Siamse Network for Face Recognition in One Shot Learning.**.
Welcome to the README file for our project on **face recognition for login** using the Siamese network in one-shot learning method. In today's world, security is a critical aspect of every system, and face recognition is a reliable technology to achieve it. With the increasing demand for a seamless login experience, face recognition is becoming more popular as an authentication method.

Our project focuses on using the Siamese network for face recognition, which is a type of **neural network** that learns to recognize faces in a **one-shot learning** method. The Siamese network is a powerful tool that can learn to recognize faces even when given very few examples. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where only one image of a person's face is available for authentication.

In this README file, we will explain the methodology and implementation of our face recognition project using the Siamese network in one-shot learning. We will also provide the necessary instructions for running our code and reproducing our results. So, let's get started!
